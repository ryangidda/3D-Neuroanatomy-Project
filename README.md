# Creating an immersive 3D digital framework for human neuroanatomy
This repository houses the source code for the development of an interactive teaching aid for human neuroanatomy, as part of my Part II PDN research project. One of the aims of this project is to develop a teaching resource for use in practical neuroanatomy sessions. We have used the process of photogrammetry to reproduce digital version of real life brain specimens from the Cambridge University anatomy department dissection room. These 3D digital reconstructions represent highly accurate, interactive objects students can use to enhance their learning of a classically difficult subject. This repository has been created as a means of updating the functionality of the teaching resource. I hope this will facilitate the creation and evolution of many different commands, in order to produce an effective and powerful teaching tool. 

# Current commands
Rotation - Using the keyboard inputs 'W', 'A', 'D' and 'S', this allows object rotation. 

Panning - Using mouse left click and drag input this allows perspective pan of the scene. 

Restart - Using the 'R' key this resets the scene to the starting configuration. 

Zoom - Using the up and down arrow keys, this zooms the camera in and out of the scene. 

# Requirements
This resource is designed to run within the Unity 3D game engine. Digital specimens are created and imported into the Unity game scene has a .obj file. All scripts should be applied to the game object, apart from the zoom script which should be applied to the camera. 


# Future Development 
 - Touchpad functionality 
 - Highlighting of specific structures
 - Pathway visualisation
 - Structure ghosting
